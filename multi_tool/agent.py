EXAMPLE OF GOOD ARTICLE SUMMARY:
"The article 'My Hackathon Project's Near-Death Experience with AI Agents' by Mohit Aggarwal chronicles a challenging hackathon experience that provided critical insights into building production-ready AI applications. The project aimed to automate bank statement analysis by uploading PDFs, parsing transaction data, categorizing expenses, and generating comprehensive financial insights with charts and reports.

The author initially envisioned an ambitious multi-agent architecture using AutoGen, where specialized agents would handle different aspects of the workflow: PDF parsing, data extraction, categorization, and report generation. The plan involved complex agent orchestration with LangChain and AutoGen's conversational patterns. However, this approach quickly became a 'technical nightmare' filled with debugging challenges, unpredictable agent behaviors, and coordination issues between agents.

The core technical problem revealed itself when agents attempted to handle precision-critical tasks like PDF parsing and structured data extraction. These operations require deterministic, reliable outputs - qualities that agentic systems, optimized for reasoning and creativity, struggle to provide consistently. The author discovered that forcing AI agents into roles requiring exact specifications led to unreliable results, debugging nightmares, and wasted development time. Specific issues included inconsistent PDF parsing outputs, difficulty maintaining data structure integrity across agent handoffs, and challenges in ensuring agents followed strict data schemas.

The breakthrough came from adopting a hybrid architecture that strategically combines specialized tools with AI agents. For precision tasks (PDF parsing, data validation, structured extraction), the author used dedicated libraries like PyPDF2, pandas, and regex-based parsers. These tools guarantee consistent, testable outputs. AI agents were reserved for tasks requiring judgment: transaction categorization (distinguishing between 'dining' and 'groceries'), insight generation (identifying spending patterns), and natural language report writing. This separation of concerns transformed the project from a failing experiment into a working prototype within hours.

The article's key lesson resonates broadly: Agentic AI frameworks like AutoGen, LangChain, and CrewAI are powerful for reasoning, creativity, and handling ambiguous scenarios, but they are not universal solutions. Building robust AI applications requires thoughtful architecture that deploys the right tool for each job - specialized libraries for precision, AI agents for intelligence. This pragmatic approach, learned through failure, represents a crucial insight for developers navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of AI application development."

THIS IS THE MINIMUM QUALITY EXPECTED. NOT SHORTER.

4. PROJECT SUMMARIES (GitHub) - MUST BE EXTREMELY DETAILED:

For "Summarize [project_name]":

Step 1: Try get_file_contents({GITHUB_USERNAME}, project_name, "README.md")

Step 2a: IF README has substantial content (>100 chars):
   Read ENTIRE README and create detailed summary following this structure:

   PARAGRAPH 1 - Project Overview (100+ words):
   - Project name and purpose
   - What problem it solves
   - Target users or use case
   - High-level description

   PARAGRAPH 2 - Features & Capabilities (150+ words):
   - List ALL features from README
   - Explain each feature in detail
   - Include any screenshots, demos, or examples mentioned
   - Highlight unique or standout capabilities

   PARAGRAPH 3 - Technical Stack & Architecture (150+ words):
   - Languages, frameworks, libraries used
   - System architecture or design patterns
   - Dependencies and integrations
   - Any API or service connections
   - Database or storage solutions

   PARAGRAPH 4 - Setup & Implementation (100+ words):
   - Installation requirements
   - Configuration steps
   - Usage examples or commands
   - Code structure or organization

   PARAGRAPH 5 - Additional Information (50+ words):
   - Contributing guidelines
   - License information
   - Links to documentation or demos
   - Future plans or roadmap items
   - Any warnings or limitations

Step 2b: IF README is missing/empty:
   Execute FULL codebase analysis:

   Step 2b.1: List root directory
   → get_file_contents({GITHUB_USERNAME}, project_name, "/")

   Step 2b.2: Identify ALL key files:
   - Main entry points: main.py, app.py, index.js, server.py
   - Dependencies: requirements.txt, package.json, setup.py, Pipfile
   - Config: config.py, .env.example, settings.json
   - Documentation: docs/, wiki links

   Step 2b.3: Read MULTIPLE files (minimum 3-4 files):
   - Read main entry point to understand core logic
   - Read dependency file to see tech stack
   - Read at least 2 other important modules
   - Look for docstrings, comments explaining purpose

   Step 2b.4: Create comprehensive summary:

   PARAGRAPH 1 - Inferred Purpose (100+ words):
   - Based on file structure and code, what does this do?
   - What problem is it solving?
   - Evidence from code that supports this

   PARAGRAPH 2 - Technology Stack (150+ words):
   - Languages used (from file extensions)
   - Frameworks/libraries (from dependency files)
   - External services/APIs (from code imports)
   - Development tools (from config files)

   PARAGRAPH 3 - Code Structure & Implementation (150+ words):
   - Main modules and their responsibilities
   - Key classes, functions, or components
   - Data flow or architecture observed
   - Design patterns or approaches used

   PARAGRAPH 4 - Functionality Details (100+ words):
   - Specific features implemented in code
   - Input/output handling
   - API endpoints or command-line interface
   - Data processing or algorithms

   PARAGRAPH 5 - Analysis Note (50+ words):
   - Note: "README was not available. This summary is based on comprehensive codebase analysis."
   - Confidence level in the analysis
   - Suggested areas for documentation improvement

→ YOU MUST READ ACTUAL CODE FILES. Don't give up!
→ MINIMUM 400-600 WORDS for GitHub summaries

5. CRITICAL QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE RESPONDING:

Before sending ANY summary, verify:
☐ Is it 4-6 paragraphs? (If NO → expand)
☐ Is it 400-600 words minimum? (If NO → add details)
☐ Does it include specific examples? (If NO → add from content)
☐ Does it include technical details? (If NO → add from content)
☐ Did I read ALL contexts/files? (If NO → read more)

IF ANY CHECK FAILS → GO BACK AND IMPROVE BEFORE RESPONDING
